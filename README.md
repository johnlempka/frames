frames
======

Frames is a node.js app that allows you to easily browse Instagram for photos based on tags or geolocation information. Frames
also allows you to construct custom galleries out of these images &mdash; meaning that it allows you to curate Instagram galleries
by searching through tags and/or geolocations.

The project was designed as a backend for a project I've been working on, to curate copies of "the same" image.

Frames stores everything in redis.

You can see the app live [here](http://framesss.herokuapp.com), and a sample gallery &mdash; Mike Kelley at MoMA PS1 &mdash; [here](http://framesss.herokuapp.com/images/collections/mike%20kelley).
