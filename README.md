frames
======

Frames is a node.js app that allows you to easily browse Instagram for photos based on tags or geolocation information. Frames
also allows you to construct custom galleries out of these images -- meaning that it allows you to curate Instagram galleries
by searching through tags and/or geolocations.

The project was designed as a backend for a project I've been working on, to curate copies of "the same" image.

Frames stores everything in redis.

You can see a sample gallery -- Mike Kelley at MoMA PS1 -- here.
